Uber Ride Analysis
---------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Uber ride data. The analysis focuses on understanding ride patterns, trip durations, distances, and the distribution of ride purposes and categories. The primary goal is to derive actionable insights that could help in optimizing ride operations and understanding customer behavior.

Repository Structure:
• UberDataset.csv – The dataset file containing Uber ride records.
• Uber_Ride_Analysis.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook that contains the complete code for data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization of the ride data.
• README.md – This documentation file explaining the project, methodology, and usage instructions.

Data Description:
The dataset consists of 1156 entries with the following columns:
• START_DATE: The starting date and time of the ride (as a string, later converted to datetime).
• END_DATE: The ending date and time of the ride (as a string, later converted to datetime).
• CATEGORY: Category of the ride (e.g., Business, Personal).
• START: Starting location of the ride.
• STOP: Destination of the ride.
• MILES: Distance of the ride in miles.
• PURPOSE: The purpose of the ride (e.g., Meeting, Errand/Supplies, Meal/Entertain).

Data Summary:
• Shape: (1156, 7)
• Missing Values:
  - PURPOSE: 503 missing values.
  - Other columns have few or no missing values.
• Unique Values:
  - START_DATE: 1155 unique values.
  - END_DATE: 1154 unique values.
  - CATEGORY: 2 unique values.
  - START: 177 unique values.
  - STOP: 188 unique values.
  - MILES: 257 unique values.
  - PURPOSE: 10 unique values.
• Descriptive Statistics:
  - Numerical (MILES): Mean of 21.12 miles, with a minimum of 0.5 miles and a maximum of 12204.7 miles.
  - Categorical: Includes values such as "Business" for CATEGORY and multiple ride purposes.

Methodology:
1. Data Preparation:
   • Import required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
   • Load the dataset and handle missing values (e.g., replacing missing PURPOSE values with "NOT").
   • Convert date columns to datetime format.
   • Extract additional features such as date, time, and day-night segmentation based on the ride start time.
   • Remove rows with missing data and duplicate records.
2. Visualization & Analysis:
   • Basic Plots: Count plots for ride categories, purposes, and day/night segmentation.
   • Distance Analysis: Boxplots and distribution plots for ride miles.
   • Temporal Analysis: Bar plots and line plots showing monthly ride counts and rides per day of the week.
   • Advanced Visualizations: Scatter plots, violin plots, swarm plots, joint plots, regression plots, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots to explore relationships between ride duration, miles, and other features.
3. Additional Insights:
   • Calculation of ride duration in minutes based on the difference between END_DATE and START_DATE.
   • Detailed visual comparisons between different ride metrics to highlight trends and anomalies.

How to Run the Analysis:
1. Clone the Repository:
   • Use the command: git clone <repository_url> and navigate into the repository directory.
2. Set Up the Environment:
   • Ensure that Python is installed along with the following packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
   • Install the required libraries using the command: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   • Open the Uber_Ride_Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab using: jupyter notebook Uber_Ride_Analysis.ipynb.
   • Run the cells sequentially to execute the data cleaning, visualization, and analysis code.

Visualizations Included:
• Count Plots for CATEGORY, PURPOSE, and day/night segmentation.
• Boxplots for MILES distribution.
• Bar Plots for monthly ride counts and daily ride counts.
• Scatter and Regression Plots examining relationships between ride duration and distance.
• Violin and Swarm Plots to assess the distribution and clustering of ride distances.
• Joint and Pair Plots for in-depth analysis of multiple numerical features.
• Correlation Heatmap to show relationships among numerical variables.
• Pie Chart illustrating the proportion of ride categories.

Conclusion:
This analysis offers comprehensive insights into Uber ride data, enabling a deeper understanding of ride patterns, customer behavior, and operational metrics. The detailed visualizations help identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for optimization. For any questions or further information, please contact the repository owner.
